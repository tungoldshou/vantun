## Guidelines

To keep discussions productive and welcoming, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Be Respectful**: Treat all community members with respect and kindness.

2. **Stay On Topic**: Keep discussions relevant to the category they're posted in.

3. **Search First**: Before posting, search to see if your question or topic has already been discussed.

4. **Be Specific**: When asking questions, provide as much detail as possible including:
   - VANTUN version
   - Operating system
   - Configuration details
   - Error messages
   - Steps to reproduce issues

5. **Use Proper Formatting**: 
   - Use code blocks for configuration files and logs
