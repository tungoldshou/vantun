## Project Overview

VANTUN is a cutting-edge, high-performance tunnel protocol built on top of QUIC, designed to deliver exceptional network performance, security, and reliability. As a next-generation solution, VANTUN redefines what's possible in network tunneling with its innovative architecture and advanced features.

## Key Advantages

### 🔒 Enterprise-Grade Security
- **Secure Handshake and Session Negotiation**: Conducted via dedicated control stream for connection security

### ⚡ Exceptional Performance
- **Multiple Logical Stream Types**: Optimized interactive, bulk, and telemetry streams for different business scenarios
- **Multipath**: Intelligent use of multiple network paths for dramatically improved speed and connection stability

### 🛡️ Unmatched Reliability
- **Forward Error Correction (FEC)**: Advanced error correction ensures data integrity even in unstable network conditions
- **Hybrid Congestion Control**: Innovative hybrid algorithm combining QUIC CC with token bucket rate limiting for optimal resource utilization

### 🌐 Privacy Protection
- **Pluggable Obfuscation Module**: Advanced traffic obfuscation makes traffic appear as normal HTTP/3, effectively evading network scrutiny

### 🚀 Easy Deployment
- **Minimal Client/Server**: Command-line `client` and `server` programs for rapid deployment and ease of use

## Technology Architecture

VANTUN leverages industry-leading technologies to deliver its exceptional performance and reliability:

- **Language**: Go - High-performance, concurrent modern programming language
- **Core Library**: `quic-go` - Industry-leading QUIC protocol implementation
- **Serialization**: `github.com/fxamacker/cbor` - Efficient CBOR encoding, more compact than JSON
- **FEC**: `github.com/klauspost/reedsolomon` - High-performance Reed-Solomon encoding algorithm
- **CLI**: `cobra/viper` - Powerful command-line interface and configuration management

## Quick Start

Get VANTUN up and running in just a few minutes:

1. **Clone Repository**: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. **Build**: `go build -o bin/vantun cmd/main.go`
3. **Configure**: Create `config.json` configuration file
4. **Run**: Start server and client

For detailed steps and configuration instructions, please refer to [Demo Guide](docs/DEMOGUIDE_en.md).
